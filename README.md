# crowdr

The idea behind crowdr is to serve as a Next.js playground to explore the new Next.js 13 features.

crowdr is a tool for tracking, managing, and viewing crowdfunding projects that users have supported. The application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/). It provides an array of features such as project submission, project management, reward management, and search & filtering.

Parts of the code come from the [FrontendMasters Next.js course by Scott Moss](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-app-next-v2/dashboard-home-page/).

## Getting Started
