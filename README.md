# crowdr

The idea behind crowdr is to serve as a Next.js playground to explore the new Next.js 13 features.

crowdr is a tool for tracking, managing, and viewing crowdfunding projects that users have supported. The application is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

âš  _crowdr is a proof of concept._

I found the original inspiration in the [FrontendMasters Next.js course by Scott Moss](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/fullstack-app-next-v2/dashboard-home-page/), but I significantly rewrote the code and changed the architeture to allow for testing.

Some of the changes include:

- strict type checking (TypeScript)
- architecture changes & refactoring
- unit testing with [jest](https://jestjs.io) & [testing library](https://testing-library.com/)
- parallel data fetching for the home page with Suspense boundaries
- Alert & Modal Dialogs without external dependencies
- ability to add a reward to a project
- bug fixes and minimally adjusted styling

The logo comes from [undraw](https://undraw.co/). ðŸ©·
